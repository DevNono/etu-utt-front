# Installing add-on

There is a firefox addon that is necessary for CAS connection to work.
You can go to your firefox addon settings, and add a new addon as a file (don't browse the store, it is not stored online).

If you want to sign the addon, you need to install web-ext. You can then run the command `web-ext sign --api-key xxx --api-secret xxx`.
You can find your credentials at https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/.
